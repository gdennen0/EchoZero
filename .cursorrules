# Cursor IDE Rules for EchoZero AI Agent Development

# These rules ensure AI agents working in Cursor IDE maintain EchoZero standards

## Core Principles (ALWAYS Follow)
- "The best part is no part" - Question every addition, prefer removal
- "Simplicity and refinement are key" - Simple solutions over complex ones
- Explicit over implicit - Be clear and obvious
- Data over code - Prefer declarative approaches

## Automatic Validation (NEVER Skip)
- Run quality checks before ANY commit
- Validate council decisions against required format
- Ensure AgentAssets are synchronized with codebase
- Check core values compliance

## Code Generation (ALWAYS Use)
- Use AgentAssets code generators for boilerplate
- Generate tests automatically for new code
- Create documentation templates
- Follow established patterns

## File Operations (MANDATORY)
- Auto-sync AgentAssets on file save (.py, .md files)
- Validate changes against architecture rules
- Update documentation when code changes
- Check for broken links in encyclopedia

## AI Agent Behavior (REQUIRED)
- Record all contributions in feedback system
- Review personal performance metrics weekly
- Participate in council decisions when relevant
- Update decision tracking after major changes

## Quality Gates (AUTOMATIC)
- Pre-commit hooks run quality_checks.py
- Pull request checks validate AgentAssets sync
- CI/CD runs full validation suite
- File watchers trigger incremental sync

## Error Handling (STANDARD)
- Log all validation failures
- Provide actionable error messages
- Suggest fixes for common issues
- Escalate critical architecture violations

## Documentation (AUTOMATIC)
- Update encyclopedia when adding features
- Sync API documentation with code changes
- Validate cross-references automatically
- Generate missing documentation

## Performance Tracking (MANDATORY)
- Track quality scores for all contributions
- Monitor core values compliance
- Measure decision success rates
- Analyze improvement trends

## Integration Points (REQUIRED)
- AgentAssets scripts integrate with Cursor file operations
- Quality checks run on file save
- Auto-sync triggers on project changes
- Feedback system updates on task completion

## Emergency Procedures (WHEN NEEDED)
- If AgentAssets become outdated: Run full sync
- If quality checks fail: Fix issues before proceeding
- If architecture violations: Consult council framework
- If core values breached: Revert and redesign

# Technical Implementation Notes for Cursor IDE

## File Watcher Integration
- Monitor: src/, docs/, AgentAssets/
- Extensions: .py, .md, .json, .yml
- Actions: trigger auto_sync.py on changes

## Pre-save Hooks
- Run: quality_checks.py on modified files
- Block commit: if validation fails
- Auto-fix: apply safe corrections

## Context Awareness
- Detect: current working file and module
- Provide: relevant AgentAssets modules
- Suggest: appropriate code generation templates

## Performance Metrics
- Track: response time, quality score, compliance rate
- Report: weekly performance summaries
- Improve: based on usage patterns and feedback
