## Core Values Alignment

This module embodies "the best part is no part" by:
- **Requiring justification** - Every proposal must prove necessity
- **Questioning additions** - Council pushes back against unnecessary complexity
- **Favoring removal** - Always consider deletion as an alternative
- **Simplicity focus** - All four lenses evaluate simplicity impact

The council process ensures that only truly necessary, well-justified changes proceed, preventing accumulation of unnecessary complexity.
